      <h1>Where did we originate from?!</h1>
      <p>Our car tour business began with a simple love for the open road and a passion for sharing 
        hidden local gems with others. 
        What started as casual weekend drives with friends—showing them scenic overlooks, 
        tucked-away cafés, and historic landmarks—quickly grew into something more. 
        People kept telling me how much they enjoyed the experience, 
        how personal and relaxed it felt compared to traditional tours.
        So, We decided to turn that passion into a service. 
        With a reliable car, a deep knowledge of the area, and a commitment to creating 
        memorable journeys, 
        we launched my tour business—built on authenticity,
        storytelling, and the joy of exploring places through a local’s eyes.
